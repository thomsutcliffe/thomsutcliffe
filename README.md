### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Thom Sutcliffe. I'm a Java backend developer by trade, but I like to dabble in frontend hobby projects.

### Things I'm Proud Of

- My three kids ðŸ‘¦ ðŸ‘§ ðŸ‘§
- My awesome beard 
- My [recipes](https://github.com/thomsutcliffe/thomsutcliffe.github.io) project
- My [competitive speedcubing record](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2009SUTC01), even though I haven't practiced for ages
